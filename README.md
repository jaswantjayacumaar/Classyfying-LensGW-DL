Use of Deep Learning to Classify Lensed and Unlensed Gravitational Waves

**ABSTRACT**

Gravitational waves (GWs) are ripples in the curvature of space-time, produced by energetic processes such as the collision of two compact objects orbiting each other and core-collapse supernovae. These GWs are lensed i.e., bent near massive astrophysical objects, similar to electromagnetic waves. Lensing of GWs produces multiple images at different times and it is hard to classify a lensed GW from an unlensed one. Hence, we have decided to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the complicated features of lensed GWs and use these features to classify lensed GWs from unlensed ones. Furthermore, these features are vital to study the merger events as they possess physical significance.
